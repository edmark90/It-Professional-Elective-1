onCreate()
onCreate() is called when the system first creates the activity, serving as the entry point for one-time setup like inflating the layout and restoring saved state from a Bundle.
@Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        Log.d("Lifecycle", "onCreate");
    }



onStart()
onStart() is invoked when the activity becomes visible to the user, transitioning it to the Started state just before it becomes interactive.
    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        Log.d("Lifecycle", "onStart");
    }



onResume()
onResume() is called when the activity enters the foreground and can interact with the user, making it the ideal point to start user-facing features.
    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        Log.d("Lifecycle", "onResume");
    }




onPause()
onPause() is triggered as the first sign the user is leaving the activity, indicating it's no longer in the foreground but might still be partially visible (e.g., in multi-window mode).
    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        Log.d("Lifecycle", "onPause");
    }




 @Override
  onStop()
onStop() occurs when the activity is no longer visible to the user, placing it in the Stopped state where it's still in memory but detached from the window.
  protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        Log.d("Lifecycle", "onStop");
    }




onDestroy()
onDestroy() is the final callback invoked before the activity is destroyed, either because it's finishing normally or the system is reclaiming resources.
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        Log.d("Lifecycle", "onDestroy");
    }
